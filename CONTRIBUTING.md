## How to Contribute

Here are guides for submitting issues and pull requests.

### Issues

Issues let us know of things we should fix, things we should add, questions, etc. 

1) Head [here](https://github.com/KingPixil/wing/issues/new) to submit a new issue.

2) Include a descriptive title that is straight to the point.

3) Write a detailed description on what the issue is all about.

4) Wait for someone to get to the issue and add labels.

5) The issue will be fixed soon!


### Pull Requests

Pull Requests allow you to share your own code with us, and we can merge it into the main repo.

**Adding Code**

1) Fork the repo.

2) Clone the repo by running 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/wing.git
```

3) Install node.js if you haven't already, and run `npm install`. This installs the required dependencies for building Wing.

4) Edit files in the `src/` folder. For example, if you are fixing up forms, head to `src/forms.css` and add changes. Don't edit any files in the `dist/` folder, this is only for distribution builds, which are automated. 

5) Run `gulp` to run builds, and the new distribution files will be in the `dist/` folder ready to go.
